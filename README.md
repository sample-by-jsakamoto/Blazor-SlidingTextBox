# Sliding TextBox Demo (Blazor)

This is a Blazor WebAssembly demo that showcases a smooth scrolling implementation to improve readability in translated subtitle systems. (You can see the React version [here](https://github.com/sample-by-jsakamoto/React-SlidingTextBox).)

When new text is added, typical implementations cause existing text to jump abruptly, making it difficult to read. The SlidingTextBox component solves this problem with smooth animation display.

**Left (Normal)**: Abrupt scrolling  
**Right (Sliding)**: Smooth slide-in animation
